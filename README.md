# Cycilist Case Study

## [Business Goal and Objective]

Their is a Cyclistic, (a bike-share company) in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclist bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

-\> *In this step, I asked myself questions such as 'How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?' to guide my analysis. As a junior data analyst working at Cyclic, my task is to help the marketing team analyze the differences between Casual riders and Members with the goal of providing recommendations that will help convert Casual riders into annual Members to maximize profit.*
